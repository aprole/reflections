What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you run git init, git creates a repository in the working directory by generating the metadata files, which will allow it to keep trake of the repository state and identify the folder as a container for the repository.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is an intermediate state between the state of the working directory and the commit. It allows you to bundle several add actions into a single commit, and also to review them before committing the changes into a commit.
