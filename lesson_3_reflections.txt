When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  You would want to use a remote repository to allow others to access/contribute to your work. 
  It would also be convenient if you would like to access the repository from multiple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If you are in the middle of working on something and the remote repository was automatically pulled, it could affect your work. Changes from commits that are automatically pulled may interfere with your current changes or cause confusion.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	-A fork is specific to GitHub. It is a copy of another repository that gets placed into your github account. The forked repo can then be cloned to your machine. The view of a forked repository in GitHub will contain a link to the original repository from which it was forked. Forks are useful in cases where you don't have permission to push to a repository. 
	-A clone is a copy of another repository. Changes made to a clone can be pushed back to the remote repo from which it was cloned. 
	-A branch exists within a repository. Any changes made in one branch will be isolated from changes that occur in another branch. Branches can be merged or kept isolated, whereas changes in clones can only be pushed back to a remote repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	It will allow you to know if your local repo is behind, ahead, or out of sync with the remote. The git status and git log commands operate on the information in the local repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	collaborating without Git/GitHub:
	-I would probably communicate any change requests to documents via email, and wait for others approval. I would make an effort to establish some
	rules about maintaining a central repository of documents which everyone agrees on.
	-Easier: none of the collaborators would need to know how to use Git or GitHub.
	-Harder: It would require more work and emails to get everyone on the same page and avoid confusion. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	-If you are collaborating with others and want to create a pull request to have the changes approved before merging them into master.
	-If you're working on a large feature and don't want to affect the main branch during the development of that feature
	benefits of working in a separate branch: 
		-will not break the build
		-commits that are related to the feature that is being implemented in the separate branch will be compartmentalized into that branch
